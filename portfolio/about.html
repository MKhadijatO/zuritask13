        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>I am generally known by friends and acquaintances as simple, 
            friendly and assertive. I have an interest in IT and I have been 
            exploring this path and trying my hands on some aspect; programming 
            and designing.</p>
        <p>It is safe to say that I am a graphic designer, a UI/UX designer in the 
            making. And now, with the my previous training in frontend development, 
            I am on the journey to become a full stack web developer.
